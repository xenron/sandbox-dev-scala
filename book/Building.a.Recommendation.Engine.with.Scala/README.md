## How to build?


Usually you only need to have above dependencies installed. Other dependencies are mentioned in the book as required.

For the most part you only need to invoke following command:

    sbt 'run-main <FULLY-QUALIFIED-CLASS-NAME> <ARGUMENTS>'


Where `<FULLY-QUALIFIED-CLASS-NAME>` should be replaced with complete class name and
`<ARGUMENTS>` should be replaced with the Command Line arguments.
